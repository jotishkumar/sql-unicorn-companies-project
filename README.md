## SQL Mini Project: Analyzing Unicorn Companies

## Project Overview
This project was completed as part of the Data Analytics Bootcamp at Atomcamp. It focuses on analyzing a dataset of unicorn companiesâ€”privately held firms valued at over $1 
billion. The goal of this project is to uncover insights about global trends, sectors, and key investors within the unicorn ecosystem.

## Objectives
Identify top countries and industries driving unicorn growth.
Highlight high-growth sectors like FinTech and AI.
Analyze unicorns founded after 2010 and their valuations.
Identify common investors backing unicorn companies.
Calculate total valuations in specific sectors such as FinTech.

## Dataset
The dataset contains information on unicorn companies, including:

Company Name
Valuation (in billions)
Country
Industry
Year Founded
Lead Investors

## Key Insights
Top countries contributing to unicorn growth.
Sectors experiencing the most rapid valuation increases.
Common investors in billion-dollar companies.

## SQL Queries
This project utilized various SQL queries to:

Filter data based on specific criteria (e.g., companies founded after 2010).
Calculate total valuations for certain sectors.
Analyze trends based on the number of unicorns per country and industry.

## Challenges
Understanding growth patterns across different decades.
Identifying top investors with large unicorn portfolios.
## Learnings
This project strengthened my SQL skills and enhanced my ability to extract actionable insights from data. It further reinforced the importance of data analysis in shaping
business strategies.
